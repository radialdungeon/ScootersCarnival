<h1><b>Hello we are Radial Dungeon!</b></h1>


<p>
This is our devlog chronicling the creation of our first project: <b>Scooter's Carnival</b>.
Look forward to a blend of action and roleplaying elements set in a dreamlike world.
Dive into the dark and erie atmosphere of an abandoned park where you must reconcile your past and face the phantoms that reside there...
