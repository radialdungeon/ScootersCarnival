    This is our devlog chronicling the creation of our first project: <b>Scooter's Carnival</b>.<br>
    Look forward to a blend of action and roleplaying elements set in a dreamlike world. <br>
    Dive into the dark and erie atmosphere of an abandoned park where you must reconcile your past and face the phantoms that reside there...
